"""Extended Status Specs API.

Extended Status are a way to provide error information in the system and to a
user eventually. The API in this file enables to store declaration and static
information of errors in a proto file. The proto file must contain a message of
type intrinsic_proto.assets.StatusSpecs (alternatively, this can also be
provided as a static list once during initialization).

General use is to call init_once() once per process. After that, create() can be
used to create errors easily. Referencing the respective error code, static
information such as title and recovery instructions are read from the
file. Errors which are not declared will raise a warning. The proto file can
also be used to generate documentation.

This API is intended to be used for a specific component which is run as a
process, it is not to be used in API libraries.

  where 34 and 20 would be values that occurred during execution). Typical would
  be a format string using format-string. You can provide additional options
  with additional information, in particular context (upstream errors in the
  form of ExtendedStatus protos).

  extended status with the given information, but also add a context extended

    external_report_message: Information for the user to analyze the error. Be
      as specific as possible, typically this would be a formatted string.

    timestamp: A timestamp to associate with the extended status, defaults to
      the current time. Set this if a more precise time is available and could
      help during debugging, e.g., for data association.
    grpc_code: Generic gRPC code to associate with this error. You may use this
