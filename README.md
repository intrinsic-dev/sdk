robotic solutions from concept to deployment.

In addition to this
[SDK repository](https://github.com/intrinsic-ai/sdk), there is a
companion repository with
[examples](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/sdk-examples) and a dev container
[project template](https://github.com/intrinsic-dev/project-template).
